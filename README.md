TOP - Etch A Sketch Project

1/14/2023 - Met all the initial requirements for this project. It's simple in design and function, but I was able to complete it with minimal googleing for syntax. Was proud I did not have to search for any help on how to accomplish what I wanted. Have ideas on how to improve the overall look/responsiveness and to add functions such as an eraser, color selector or random rainbow brush. May incorporate these later or may move on as I feel like I would know how to do these things, it would just take time and I'm not sure I'm that into this project.
